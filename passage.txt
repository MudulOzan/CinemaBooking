"Dreams of migratory birds", the latest work of Ciro Guerry (nominated for an Oscar for "In the embrace of the snake") and Cristina Gallego, is a visually stunning story about the beginnings of Colombian drug trade, linked to the history of the indigenous community of Wayúu Indians. Greed, rivalry between gangs, passion - they question the traditional values given by their ancestors.
Colombia during the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. The barren and windy wastes on the border of the country are inhabited by the Wayúu Indian people. During the tribal rite of entering into adulthood Zaida (Natalia Reyes) performs a traditional dance, which tempts potential candidate for her husband - Rapayet (José Acosta). However, Ursula (Carmiña Martínez), who is at the head of the clan, gives the young Rapayet a high price to pay for Zaid. Rapayet is looking for a way to quickly get money. Together with his partner, Moises (Jhon Narváez), they meet American hippies seeking access to marijuana suppliers. Rapayet and Moses themselves take on the role of dealers, and the business they will dress up will only be the beginning of history ...
"Dreams of migratory birds" were screened during this year's edition of the Cannes Film Festival in the section Quinzaine des Réalisateurs.
