1993, Korea remains the last state in the Cold War. The tensions accompanying the development of nuclear weapons are gaining momentum. Suk-young Park, a former military officer working for South Korean intelligence, is sent on a spy mission to a nuclear facility located in North Korea. Suk-young, posing as a businessman conducting business with North Korea, contacts Ri Myong-un, a high-ranking North Korean official. After many years of efforts, the protagonist finally manages to gain the confidence of the ruling class and confirm the large inter-Korean contract. The park, however, discovers that both sides share secret private interests interfering in the presidential election in South Korea.
