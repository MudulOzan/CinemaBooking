A few-year-old Michael lives with his dad in a small hut on the shore of the ocean. One day while playing on the beach, he finds three orphan tiny pelicans. This is how an extremely moving, humorous and adventurous story begins with the friendship of a boy with one of the pelicans, called Mr. Percival. A story about how much they can give and how much they can learn from each other. The learning of flying, the fight against poachers hunting for coastal birds and endless common fools, strengthen the extraordinary bond between Michael and the animal. In the end, however, comes the moment when the pelican is growing up, and the boy has to leave the house on the beach. Is their friendship able to survive? 
After many years, a wealthy businessman Michael Kingsley (Geoffrey Rush) returns to his homeland to tell his beloved granddaughter about an extraordinary childhood friend. Standing at the threshold of life summaries, he understands that this is not a family fortune, but this extraordinary story is something the most valuable, which can be conveyed by Madeline.
